# Code-Quiz

As you proceed in your career as a web developer, you will probably be asked to complete a coding assessment. These assessments are typically a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive challenges. In this homework assignment, your challenge is to build a code quiz with multiple-choice questions.

How this was done: 

When user first gets to the page it will give them the option to "Start Quiz." 

When the "Start Quiz" button is clicked the user will be presented with a series of questions and timer has a value and immediately starts the countdown. 

The final score is calculated by the time remaining. Answering quickly and correctly will lead to a higher score. But answering incorrectly results in a time penalty. 

When all questions have been answered or the timer runs out, the user is presented with a form to enter their initials and scores are stored in localStorage.
